            <div class="company-info">
                During my internship at Cargill, I primarily worked on an application development team where I 
                built a REST API endpoint using Hibernate ORM and PostgreSQL, enabling CRUD operations with material 
                and product data, which is accessed by over 2,500 users from more than 400 locations worldwide. 
                The front end side of this project was to develop a data grid for strategic analysis using TypeScript, React.js,
                and Material-UI. This tool efficiently handled over 980,000 database entries, providing users with 
                advanced filtering, searching, and data manipulation capabilities. 
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I had the opprutunity to work with on Quantitative Execution Platform. I optimized 
                Black-Scholes calculations for pricing options contracts, achieving a fourfold decrease in latency 
                through C++ optimizations which I validated using the GTest Library. Addtionlly, I decreased the 
                execution time of a concurrent queue within the core trading engine library by implementing fine-grained 
                locking in C++, resulting in a 30% reduction in latency, also verified through benchmarking with the GTest Library.

            <div class="company-info">
                I spent the summer before my junior year of college working as an IT Automation Intern for Travel and Leisure. I worked
                on various tasks including but not limited to taking and solving bug reports posted to Kanban boards, formulating correct
                correct coding style across a large repository for readability, creating large amounts of test data and unit tests,
                and finally building an automated testing tool for a digital suite. The testing tool's purpose was to create testing 
                identifiers which would later be used in stress testing. The tool I created was written in Java and used API orchestration
                in order to achieve a 8x efficeny increase in creating the required test-data.
